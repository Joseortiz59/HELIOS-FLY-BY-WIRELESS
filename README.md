## HELIOS-FLY-BY-WIRELESS
#NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019


It was chosen the challenge Fly-By-Wireless, which was proposed by NASA, and where the objective is to design an aircraft, that flies using wireless technology, so with this can be reduced partially the wiringâ€™s weight of the aircraft, it's also proposed the reduction of any weight without damaging the integrity, security and comfortability. In other words, the project consist in reducing as much as possible the unnecessary wiring like cables, connectors and penetrations, in order to gain more payload.
